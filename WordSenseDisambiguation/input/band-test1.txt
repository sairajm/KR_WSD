To see a threat that was coming across as anything but a threat is saddening  They have a music biz ring through their noses the last rock band. 
On September 27  1986  there appeared an interview with Morrissey conducted by fellow Mancunian  Frank Owen  Now Owen shared a similar cultural background to Morrissey &dash  he used to hang around the same clubs  he was singer with the post punk band Manicured Noise  a band often linked with Morrisseys beloved Ludus  and the feature was a fascinating if bewildering jumble of nostalgic bonhomie. 
It was shortly after this that he told me all about the rehearsals he was involved in in London and his involvement with Dominic Muldowney and Louis Marks making the production of the Bertholt Brecht play Baal and I remember he wanted to record it as a souvenir and said that it was not going to be any big deal and probably wouldnt sell  but felt it should be recorded for posterity  We had long meetings with Dominic which was the first time that I had ever worked with a serious composer and I remember going to see Dominic at the South Bank Complex and going round many winding rooms and hearing the operatic rehearsals and was very impressed  On the television programme  the music was very simply scored for a few instruments and banjo  but we wanted to record it actually in Berlin in the style of Bertholt Brecht using a typical German pit band or  in other words  a small orchestra comprising of one of each instrument &dash  one violin  one viola  one trumpet  one accordion &dash  and that was the way we approached it. 
By the evening of July 20 nearly a quarter of the distance had been covered  crowds had gathered every day to watch progress  and on the previous Sunday the number of visitors was estimated to be between 1 000 and 1 500  so it was not surprising that <ignore type=deadGuys>every drop of liquor in Mr Simmonds house was consumed </ignore> Throughout the following week the crowds continued Miss Richards was suffering severely from the hot weather  but her pace was still good although However  she recovered from the excessive heat  and on August 12 it was reported that the grass plot  round which she walked twenty two times to complete a mile  was now a beaten track like a permanent path  And so the marathon walk continued until it was successfully concluded on the evening of Monday  August 21  but before that ultimate triumph Miss Richards toured the city in an open brake drawn by three horses  attired in her walking costume and accompanied by a brass band  acknowledging gracefully the plaudits of those who thronged the streets. 
Mr Sunderland himself had driven her home in his car  and she had begged him to leave her at the gate so as not to alarm her family  Everyone said she must have struggled from her sick bed the moment she realized that the aunt left in charge during her illness had sadly neglected her little boy  Alan Duffy had overheard Mr Simmons and Miss Craven talking about Frankies father  who was a real life American who had been in the Army and the merchant navy and was now a farmer who posed at the School of Art and played guitar in a popular local band band. 
She was beginning to hate herself for feeling guilty that she could not love him as he wanted  The steel band gave way to a pair of medics singing a comic song about sinusitis and trying to tapdance in frogmans fins. 
This did not confuse the fans  who were immediately familiar with the material  providing word perfect singalongs to new lyrics like `Its OK  baby  its OK   At the end of this intrusion  Rossi told us that was enough new stuff big cheer because he had to think about it `And thinking doesnt go with this band  does it?. 
They were going to put on the big show  They had a band and a guard of honour outside the station  their backs to a row of railwaymens cottages. 
Both were tactically very good  John could really read a race and was so good at presenting a horse at a fence   But turn back another page in the history of National Hunt heroes and there is a band of jockeys whose winning totals  lacking the help of helicopters  an expanded fixture list and Martin Pipe  have long since been eclipsed by Scudamore  but whose deeds live on. 
And conservative forces everywhere have always said that  This dance music is the devils music!  NOT CONTENT with being the single most sought after band on the Sub Pop roster with no fewer than four major labels seriously chasing their signatures  NIRVANA are playing merry hell with the distributors of their new single `Silver / Dive. 
When he came out he worked briefly with Art Hodes and then led his own band in St Louis before moving into Condons Club in New York in December 1945  After that he had star status and played mainly as a guest with other bands  When he first visited London with Condons band in 1957 Bill was `drinking two bottles of Scotch a day and whatever anyone else forced on me. 
This was backed up by the famous John Peel Festive Fifty which was embarrassingly dominated by the band  Melody Maker hid a definite nod of acceptance behind a peppering of harmless insults  The glossies followed suit  dutifully documenting the band progress and blindly including this strange bunch of yokels among the smiling blonds beautiful masses.
Even the most modest promotional push entails an expense of resources amounting virtually to the defence budget of a developing nation  Which leaves the Green pop musician with a dilemma how to draw on the oxygen of publicity without polluting the air? A band from Essex called The Brotherhood of Lizards are taking their principles with them into the field by touring to promote their first album Lizardland  Deltic Records  not in the obligatory transit van  but on bicycles. 
All it needs is one ill timed abbreviation and a deal could go out of the window  THE MERRY band which makes up the Australian financial markets seems as attached to a lunchtime tipple as ever. 
Of the two  Id go for the Polydor collection  partly because it serves as a decent sampler of a wider range of Brazilian talent  like Caetano Veloso and Luiz Caldas  although dance parties are probably better served by the CBS LPs flow of smooth Miami Sound alikes  WITH THE recent commercial success of band like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays  you could be forgiven for thinking that British pop had entered its first new phase since the `pure pop  explosion of 1982 which saw the emergence of acts like the Human League  Altered Images and Haircut 100. 
`Im very proud of the fact that our music flies in the face of the accepted notions of youth culture and attracts all ages  Community here is vital for a band. 
The most important song in the world was released in May 1983  Backed with `Handsome Devil   it proved the perfect artifact to display the succinct yet overall perception of just what this strange new band was all about. 
Scott Fitzgerald dubbed the Twenties `the jazz age  but in truth the Fifties did more to earn that title  The line of jazz development was splitting into its separate streams  Progressive or `cool  modern jazz was still a minor tributary  exploring the experimental language of Bop discovered by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie for a small  dedicated band of disciples.
Another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage  it will be a good evening  There are two types of pub rock occasions those  like the one described above  where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia and those where the pub is so crowded  death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out. 
But just to prove what a bunch of contrary bastards they can still be  `Arms Control Poseur   combining a relentless bass drum with Smiths diffident sneering  soars about the me&circ le&acute e  shattering any doubts as to the bands continued well being  As irritable as ever Mark Smiths only comment was to compare the trendy utilitarian decor of The Waterfront to that of an open prison  The Falls lip cuts more ice when its backed up by more than just Smiths mouthings  The stonking irony is that a disappointing Fall gig remains worthy of two of most other band. 
The debuting vocalist therefore spent the entire set stooping to sing through a microphone a foot shorter than his requirement  hardly a sure fire confidence booster  They stumbled through  relying in practice room unity and the simplicity of their classical rock band format to ease the atrocious sound problems.
