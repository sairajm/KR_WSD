Review of Heat Transfer
Fundamentals
• Convection – heat transfer via flowing
fluids
• Conduction – heat transfer within materials
other than flowing fluids
• Radiation – heat transfer via
electromagnetic waves
7
Convection
• h = heat transfer coefficient
• Important to spacecraft during launch after
fairing separation
• Convective heat transfer is used in some
pumped-liquid thermal control systems,
especially in manned spacecraft

At any temperature above absolute zero, all materials emit thermal (blackbody)
radiation.
For a perfect blackbody, the rate of total energy emission and the energy
distribution across all wavelengths is strictly a function of the absolute temperature
T.
For spacecraft and atmosphere covered planets these distributions are
modified, but we usually use the perfect blackbody energy distribution at least as an
initial estimate.
Planck’s equation gives us the spectral energy distribution of a
perfect blackbody. Eb is the energy per unit wavelength of a blackbody.

11
Kirchoff’s Law
• Monochromatic emissivity =
monochromatic absorptivity
• However, emissivity and absorptivity for a
given material vary with wavelength
• E.g., white paint as=0.4, eIR=0.8
At a given frequency, Kirchoff’s law says that the emissivity and absorbtivity will
be the same.
White paint on spacecraft will have a low equilibrium temperature because it
absorbs little energy in the frequencies of the solar spectra, but may have a high
emissivity at the IR frequencies associated with the bodies temperature.
Called a selective surface
12
View Factor
• F1-2 is the view factor from surface 1 with
area A1 to surface 2 with area A2
• A1 F1-2 = A2F2-1
A2
A1
The view factor is a function of the size, geometry, relative position, and orientation
of two surfaces.
Assume a diffuse gray surface condition, I.e., that a particular surface emits equally
in all directions and emmissivity and absorptivity are not strong functions of
wavelength.
13
Radiation Equation
• Into deep space q=seAT4
• Between two surfaces
q=se1e2 A1 F1-2 (T1
4- T2
4)
• If one surface is Earth, assume e=1 and
T=250 to 260 K
Technically, q= A(T4- T4) but T deep space is 4K, <<T4
We can use these equations to calculate the heat transfer between two surfaces, once
we calculate the view factor.

Dissipated energy is primarily referring to the heat generated by electrical
equipment
For transparent materials with no internal dissipation, energy is either absorbed,
reflected or transmitted

The absorbed energy is the solar flux times the area times the absorbtivity times the
cosine of the incidence angle.
The solar flux is 1418 W/m2 on average around earth, but it depends on the distance
from the sun and other factors.
The emitted energy is proportional to the area and the surface temperature to the
fourth power.
With no internal dissipation, the bottom equation gives us the equilibrium
temperature of a surface. Note the relationship of emissivity in the denominator and
absorptivity in the numerator.
16
Space Radiators
Gsa*cos(?) + QW/AR – seT4 = 0
QW is the heat to be rejected
QW is the waste heat we are trying to get rid of in a space radiator. We generally
orient radiators to minimize the incident radiation.
Using this equation we can determine the temperature of a radiator that is used to
eliminate a given amount of energy, or we can determine the amount of energy that
will be removed for a radiator at a particular temperature.

qIa= qI
sin2??eb = energy absorbed on the
bottom surface
The energy flux at a given altitude is lower than at the surface of the earth by the
ratio of the area of the surface of the earth to the area of a sphere with a radius equal
to the spacecraft’s altitude plus the radius of the earth.
The energy absorbed by the spacecraft is given by the bottom equation. Note that
we used the emissivity in this equation because the radiant energy is IR.
Choose the + or the – based on whether you are calculating the maximum or
minimum temperature.

Summing up
The emitted energy includes emissions from both the top and bottom of the array,
which may have different emissivities.
In the energy balance we subtract out the energy produced by the solar array, which
is a fraction of the incident solar energy (eta)

Thermal Property Degradation
• UV radiation degrades solar absorptivity
with time
– Absorptivity increases and reaches an upper
limit exponentially with time
• Outgassing, contamination, material
instability affect thermo-optical properties
Most surfaces approach a gray-brown color after some time in space.
As absorptivity increases, the spacecraft heats up.
Must consider end of life absorptivity in equilibrium temperature calculations.

The temperature rise of a material in a given amount of time is called its heat
capacity and the proportionality constant is cp (the specific heat capacity of the
material.)
Equation not applicable to phase change situations.
25
Thermal Control Components
• Materials and coatings
– Selective surfaces (as does not equal eIR)
– Paints, mirrors, silvered plastics, anodized
materials
– Optical Solar Reflectors (OSR)
• Second surface mirror (reflector) under a transparent
cover (emitter)
– Silver coated Teflon is much tougher and less
expensive, although not as effective
OSRs work because the cover has a very high emissivity, and the metalized
reflector reflects a large percentage of the incident radiation (the reflector by itself
has a low emissivity)
Quartz over silver
Silver coated teflon is much more commonly used because of its lower cost and
higher ruggedness.
26
Multi-layer Insulation
• Minimizes radiative heat transfer from/to a
spacecraft component
• Made of alternate layers of aluminized
Mylar or Kapton with a thin net of material
between
– Without air the primary coupling between
layers is radiative, not conductive
27
Multi-layer Insulation
• Modeled at an effective emissivity
• Larger MLI systems generally have lower
effective emissivity
• In thermal vacuum tests we must wait until
all air has escaped from the MLI blankets
(several hours)
( ) 4 4
q = se effective Th -Tc
Larger MLI systems are more effective because they have fewer seams and
penetrations per unit area.
It takes a long time to get the air out of MLI systems during tests and on orbit.

Thermal Control Components
(continued)
• Cold plates

– May use flowing fluids for convective heat
transfer
• Doublers
– Passive aluminum plates that increase heat
exchange surface area
Doubler is just an aluminum plate attached to a heat dissipator and a radiator. It
provides a heat flow path between the two and increases the area for heat exchange.
Works similar to a heat pipe but not as effectively.
30
Thermal Control Components
(continued)
• Phase change devices
– Used when heat is generated in short bursts
– Solid absorbs energy while melting
qpc mpcH pc = &
Materials absorb and release large amounts of energy during phase changes.
Phase change devices might be used in conjunction with a transmitter that is used
infrequently.
31
Thermal Control Components
(continued)
• Heat pipes
– Used to transfer heat from one area to another
– Heat at one end evaporates the working fluid, absorbing
heat
– Vaporized working fluid flows to cold end and
condenses, releasing heat
– Wicking material returns fluid to hot end
– Provide high heat transfer rates even with small
temperature differences
– Difficult to test in one-g environment

• Louvers
– Shield radiator surfaces to moderate heat flow
to space

conductor whose resistance changes with
temperature

Thermal Control Components
(continued)
• Adhesive tapes

contacting surfaces
– Thin sheets of metal oxide in elastomeric
binders
– Fills voids between contacting surfaces
Adhesive tape is used in the manufacture of MLI
Also used to modify directly the thermo-optical property of a material or structural
member
Filler is critical for creating a thermal path, but is difficult to test in the atmosphere.
34
Thermal Control Components
(continued)
• Thermal isolators

instruments and other components from the
spacecraft body
• Thermoelectric coolers

35
Thermal Control Components
(continued)
• Cryogenic systems
– Low noise amplifiers, super-conducting
materials, and IR detectors require extremely
low temperatures (<100 K)
– Active cooler systems use Stirling or Brayton
cycle pumps
– Passive systems use cryogenic liquids (e.g.,
liquid Helium) to cool instruments for short
missions
36
Thermal Analyses
• Finite difference models are used for non-linear
analysis
– Temperature prediction
– Interface heat flux
– Thermal gradients
– Temperature vs time plots
• Electrical units often are modeled by Finite
Element method (based on the structural FEM) for
internal conduction
37
