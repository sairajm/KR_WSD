THE Glenn Miller Orchestra turned back the clock for an evening of solid gold nostalgia at the Apollo theatre, Oxford, on Saturday. 
From the tune Anchors Away right through to In The Mood the young big band under the expert direction of band leader Ray McVay perfectly recreated the Miller sound. 
The voices of Sarah Gilbertson and Tony Mansell were joined by three more from the band as the Moonlight Serenaders to give us the cool harmonies of Miller's original Modernairs.
