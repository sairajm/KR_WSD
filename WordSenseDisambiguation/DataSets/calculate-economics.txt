wikiHow to Calculate Percentage Increase
Two Methods:Calculating Percentage IncreaseAlternate MethodCommunity Q&A
Knowing how to calculate percentage increase is useful in a variety of situations. For instance, even when watching the news, you'll often hear a change described in large numbers without any percentage to give them context. If you calculate the percentage increase and discover it's actually less than 1%, you'll know not to believe the scare stories. Calculating percentage increase is as simple as dividing the size of the increase by the original amount.

Calculating Percentage Increase
Image titled Calculate Percentage Increase Step 11
Write down the starting value and end value. For example, let's say your auto insurance premium just went up. Write down these values:
Your car insurance premium was $400 before the increase. This is the starting value.
After the increase, it costs $450. This is the end value.
Image titled Calculate Percentage Increase Step 22
Find the size of the increase. Subtract the starting value from the end value to find the out how much it increased.[1] We're still working with ordinary numbers at this point, not percentages.
In our example, $450 - $400 = a $50 increase.
Image titled Calculate Percentage Increase Step 33
Divide the answer by the starting value. A percentage is just a special kind of fraction. For example, "5% of doctors" is quick way to write "5 out of 100 doctors." By dividing the answer by the starting value, we turn it into a fraction that compares the two values.
In our example, $50 / $400 = 0.125.

Multiply the result by 100. This converts your last result into a percentage.
The final answer to our example is 0.125 x 100 = 12.5% increase in auto insurance premiums.

Image titled Calculate Percentage Increase Step 51
Write down the start value and end value. Let's start with a new example. The world population went from 5,300,000,00 people in 1990 to 7,400,000,000 in 2015.
There's a trick to these problems with many zeroes. Instead of counting the zeroes each step of the way, we can rewrite these as 5.3 billion and 7.4 billion.
Image titled Calculate Percentage Increase Step 62
Divide the end value by the starting value. This will tell us how much bigger the end result is than the original.[2]
7.4 billion ÷ 5.3 billion = about 1.4.
We've rounded to two significant digits because that's how many there were in the original problem.
Image titled Calculate Percentage Increase Step 73
Multiply by 100. This will tell you the percentage comparison between the two values. If the value increased (instead of decreasing), your answer should always be larger than 100.
1.4 x 100 = 140%. This means the world population in 2015 is 140% the size of the population in 1990.
Image titled Calculate Percentage Increase Step 84
Subtract 100. In this kind of problem, "100%" is the size of the starting value. By subtracting this from our answer, we're left with just the percentage size of the increase.
140% - 100% = a 40% increase in population.
This works because starting value + increase = end value. Rearrange the equation and we get increase = end value - starting value.

How do I calculate the percentage of the gain on an investment?
wikiHow Contributor
To find the annual percentage yield on an investment (assuming a gain), subtract the value of the investment at the beginning of the year from its value at the end of the year, then divide that difference by the value at the beginning of the year. That will give you a decimal number. Multiply it by 100 to get a percentage. For example, if the investment's value rose from 2,000 to 3,000 during the year, subtracting the starting value from the final value gives you 1,000. Divide that by 2,000, giving you 0.5. Multiply by 100 to get a 50% gain for the year (because 1,000 is 50% of 2,000).

How do I compute a 4% annual increase on a $511 monthly rent increase for a period of ten years?
wikiHow Contributor
Nominally it's a 40% increase over ten years, but the real (compounded) increase is considerably more than that and is calculated using an exponential formula. See wikiHow articles on compound interest.

How do I calculate $80 by 5%?
wikiHow Contributor
Multiply 80 x .05 to get 5% of 80. The answer is $4.00. If you are increasing 80 by 5%, then add the answer to 80 to get the final total which is $84.00.

What is 250 as a percentage?
wikiHow Contributor
This completely depends on what the total is. 250 could be 100%. If it's out of 500, then it's half, so 50%. If you drank 250ml of water out of a 500ml glass, you drank half the water.

What is a part time clerk's salary if he is earning R216 per week and received a salary increase of 7%?
wikiHow Contributor
R216 x 1.07 = R231.12. You take the original amount and multiply by 1.07; this is the same as adding the increase to the original amount.

How do I calculate the increase of 56 by 8%?
wikiHow Contributor
Divide 56 by 100, giving you 0.56. Then, multiply this 100th by 8. Add your answer to 56 and you will have 56 increased by 8%. Alternately, you can just multiply 56 by 1.08.

Tips
The percentage increase tells you the relative change, meaning how much it increased in relation to the starting value. A $50 increase in the price of an egg is a huge relative increase. Adding $50 to the price of a house is a tiny relative increase.
You can calculate the percentage decrease with the exact same method. You'll end up with a negative number, showing that the amount became smaller.
The size of the increase is also called the absolute change, meaning the actual quantity described.[3] A $50 increase in the price of an egg and a $50 increase in the price of a house have the same absolute increase.
