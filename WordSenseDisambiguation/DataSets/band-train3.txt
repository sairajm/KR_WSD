Crawling out from the wreckage of The Cateran, the Joyriders feature two ex-members, Murdo MacLeod and Kai Davidson, plus one tall American named Rick on drums. 
It takes four songs for them to shake off their own ghost, but halfway through the aptly named `Long Gone" it disappears. 
In the process they've lost a certain edge, for at the end The Cateran had the rage and the fury of band at its peak falling apart.
