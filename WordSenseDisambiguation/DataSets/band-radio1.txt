MOBILE RADIO: 
The Department of Trade and Industry has given the two national band III private mobile radio networks 50 new channels.  

Mr Bond and Mr Skase are two of Australia's new media barons who had swooped on assets thrown up by the Australian government's redrafting of media ownership laws. 
Mr Skase took charge of the Seven bandwhile Frank Lowy's Westfield group acquired Rupert Murdoch's Ten stations.   

Alternatively, particularly in the world of vision, we can appreciate a loose fit, using wide tolerances to obtain a group definition. 
In the everyday world of colour signalling, responses are conditioned to a few popular hues: red, yellow, blue, green, black, white, purple and, perhaps, orange.
 
These are broad concepts, each embracing a bandof frequencies in the colour spectrum. 
The example of the police radios shows the relative permanence of being allocated a piece of spectrum &dash. radios and other broadcasting equipment, whether for entertainment or communication, are designed to sort out what it wants to pick up from the rest of the signal. 
To perform well it has to be tightly targeted to cope with quite a narrow bandof frequencies.
